# PPro-Audio-Info-Export

Very simple Premiere Pro panel for exporting basic audio file info from the current timeline

Exports Name and start time from every audio file included in the timeline in the following format:

"{HH:MM:SS} {FILENAME}" 

The file will be created in your %appdata% location under the name audio_info.txt

This is just an edited version of [Adobe CEP Samples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master) 

To install, find your Program Files (x86), then Common Files, then Adobe, then CEP, and finally the extensions folder - downlad the code and throw the folder into the extensions directory
